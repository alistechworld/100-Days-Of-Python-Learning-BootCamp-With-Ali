## üß≥ What is Variable?
A variable is like a container that stores data in a program. You can give it a name and use it later to refer to the data it holds.
## Example
** name = "Alice"
name = is the variable
"Alice" is the value stored in it.

## üõ† What is Data Type?
A data type tells Python what kind of data is being stored in a variable. For example, it could be a number, text, or a True/False value.

## üóÇ Common Data Types in Python

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Integer (int)
Represents whole numbers (positive or negative, without decimals).
Examples: 10, -3, 0.
Usage: Counting or working with discrete values.
python
Copy code
apples = 5  # apples is an integer variable

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Float (float)
Represents numbers with decimal points.
Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 10.0.
Usage: Measurements or precise values.
python
Copy code
temperature = 36.5  # temperature is a float variable

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ String (str)
Represents text, enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.
Examples: "Hello", 'Python'.
Usage: Storing names, messages, or any textual data.
python
Copy code
greeting = "Hello, World!"  # greeting is a string variable

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Boolean (bool)
Can only have two values: True or False.
Usage: Useful in decision-making and conditions.
python
Copy code
is_adult = True  # is_adult is a boolean variable

## Type Conversion:

Changing one data type into another.
Example: int("5") converts "5" (string) into 5 (integer).
